# Algorithms Visualizer

A web-based tool for visualizing various sorting and searching algorithms. This project aims to provide interactive and educational insights into the inner workings of different algorithms, helping users understand their performance and behavior through visual representation.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms:** Visualize popular sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and others.
- **Searching Algorithms:** Visualize searching algorithms such as Binary Search, Linear Search, and more.
- **Performance Metrics:** Compare time and space complexity of different algorithms.
- **Interactive Data Input:** Allow users to input their own data for visualization.
- **Algorithm Comparison:** Display comparisons between different algorithms in a table format.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Next.js, CSS
- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript/DSA for frontend and algorithm logics
